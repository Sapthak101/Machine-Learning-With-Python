#everthing in python belongs to a class and the variabels that we create here are actuially objects to that class
#like an integer is an object if the class int
#synchronous to that of java all the funtions that we are using here mioght berlong to the a static funtion thus that can be called without the references to any object
#in the same class or in a different class
#and the point of execution might also start from a static funtion belonging to a class that might be implecit

print(name+name1)
#print(1+name1) one of the datatype here is string and the opther one is an integer
#that ais why ibn taht case we should use a str() funtion
#to cnvvert the value taht we have enbtered into string
print(str(5)+name1)
#in python we dont need to declare variables weith their datatyps pyhton knows the datatype opf the vaiablthat we have guven implecitely

print(name, name1)  #suing a commaa to provide a space beween two variables when they are created
#1+2+3+'car' #+means concatenation incase ther is a string with number error will be reported
print(1+1+3.5) #in pyton automatic transformation to the next higher datatype is done
1, 2, 3, 'car' #this line is fine printing his automatically provide a spce between them
#in jupytyer we have the adventage top see linewise execution, which might not be the case for VS code
#in jupyter each line can be executed seperately with the comand shift+enter
#with string '' or"" can be used but now mixe should be done
#execution without print with "" will produce a string enclosed in ''
