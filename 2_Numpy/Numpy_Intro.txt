# NumPy (or NUmpy) is a Linear Alzebra Library Library for python 
# the reason it is so important for data science with python is that almost all
# of the libraries in the PyData Ecosystem rely on the NumPy
# as one of their main building blocks
# Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries
# to install numpy in VS Code just type in the powershell command prompt PS C:\ pip install numpy
# NUmPy arrays are main way we will use Numpy throughout the course
# NUmpy arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices
# Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d 
# (a matrix having more than 1 row and 1 column)
# to update pip 
# python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
